  <h1>Secrets</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>the more you observe more likely it increases your intellect.</li>
    <li>Whenever you just don't find an answer to a problem just write it down and you will probably hit up with a solution.</li>
    <li>Do not try to be the person your parents would want you to be. Be the person you would like your child to be be.
      It more
      clearly
      defines your own convictions, desires, goals, and motivates you to be your best.</li>
    <li>when u feel the scariest to jump in ...that's the exact moment you should jump in else you will spend all your life being stucked at the same position.</li>
    <li>When a friend is upset, ask them one simple question before saying anything else: 'Do you want to talk about it
      or do
      you want to be distracted from it?' and that's the best piece of advice i really want every individual to know.</li>
    <li>If you ever forget your WiFi password or you want to get your school WiFi password etc. Just type this command
      into the
      command line of a computer already connected to that WiFi: netsh wlan show profile WiFi-name key=clear  ,that's pretty cool right? (Thanks me later!)</li>
  </ul>
