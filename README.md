# 🔐 Secret Access Project

This is a simple password-protected Node.js application built using Express.js and EJS templating. When the app is running on `localhost:3000`, users are shown an interface to enter a password. If the correct password is entered, a list of secret passwords is revealed. If the password is incorrect, the homepage reloads.

## 🚀 Features

- Node.js and Express.js for server-side handling
- EJS templating for dynamic HTML rendering
- Password-protected access
- Reveals secret content from `secret.html` on successful login
- Reloads form on incorrect password attempt


## 🛠️ How to Run the Project Locally

To use this project on your machine:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Secret-Access-Project.git
cd Secret-Access-Project

-npm install

-node index.js

Open your browser to go to:
-http://localhost:3000
```

## 🔧 How It Works

-When a user opens localhost:3000, a password input form appears.

-If the entered password matches the one defined in the backend, the user is redirected to a secrets page.

-That secrets page displays content (a list of passwords) stored in secret.html.

-If the password is incorrect, the form reloads without access.

-As it is a public project i need to provide you what's my password is : it is "ILoveProgramming" (case sensitive)
